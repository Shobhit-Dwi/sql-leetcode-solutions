# 🧠 SQL LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my personal collection of SQL solutions for LeetCode problems.  
This repository showcases my problem-solving approach, clean SQL practices, and commitment to improving my data querying skills.

## ✅ Authenticity Note
All SQL solutions in this repository were written by me from scratch.
I used AI (ChatGPT) only to help with folder formatting, naming, and generating README files to save time — not to write queries.
The purpose of this repo is to track my learning and serve as a resource for others.
